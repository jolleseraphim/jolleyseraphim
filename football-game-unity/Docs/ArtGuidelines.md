# Art Guidelines for Football Game

## 1. Art Style
The art style of the game should be vibrant and engaging, aiming for a semi-realistic look that appeals to a wide audience. The graphics should be polished, with attention to detail in player models, stadiums, and animations.

## 2. Character Design
- **Players**: Each player should have unique characteristics, including distinct hairstyles, skin tones, and body types. Use a consistent color palette that aligns with the team's branding.
- **Animations**: Player animations should be fluid and realistic, covering a range of actions such as running, kicking, passing, and celebrating.

## 3. Environment Design
- **Stadiums**: Design stadiums that reflect real-world counterparts, with attention to crowd details, lighting, and field textures.
- **Backgrounds**: Use dynamic backgrounds that change based on the match context, such as day/night cycles and weather effects.

## 4. Asset Creation
- **Textures**: Use high-resolution textures for all assets. Ensure that textures are optimized for performance without sacrificing quality.
- **Models**: Create low-polygon models for characters and objects to maintain performance, while ensuring they are visually appealing.

## 5. UI Design

## 7. Asset Formats
- All 3D models should be exported in FBX format.
- Textures should be in PNG or JPEG format, with appropriate resolutions for different asset types.

## 8. Optimization
- Regularly test assets in the game environment to ensure they perform well on target devices. Optimize models and textures as necessary to maintain frame rates.

## 9. Collaboration
- Maintain open communication with the development team to ensure that art assets align with gameplay mechanics and overall vision.

## 10. References
- Gather references from real-life football games, animations, and art styles to inspire and guide the asset creation process.
