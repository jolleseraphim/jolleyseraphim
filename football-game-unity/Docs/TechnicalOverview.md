# Technical Overview of the Football Game Project

## Introduction
This document provides a technical overview of the architecture and systems implemented in the football game project, designed to deliver an engaging gameplay experience similar to DLS 2025.

## Game Architecture
The game is structured using a component-based architecture, leveraging Unity's capabilities to manage game objects and their behaviors effectively. The main components of the architecture include:

### 1. Game Management
- **GameManager.cs**: Responsible for managing the overall game state, including starting and ending matches, tracking scores, and transitioning between different game states (e.g., main menu, in-game, game over).

### 2. Match Control
- **MatchController.cs**: Handles the logic for managing a football match, including player actions, scoring, and match duration. It coordinates interactions between players and the game environment.

### 3. Player Management
- **PlayerController.cs**: Manages player movement and actions during the game, including running, passing, and shooting.
- **PlayerAnimator.cs**: Controls animations for player movements and actions, ensuring smooth transitions and realistic animations.
- **Stamina.cs**: Manages the stamina levels of players, affecting their performance and actions during the match.

### 4. AI Management
- **AIManager.cs**: Controls the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs) during matches, ensuring they react appropriately to player actions and game events.
- **TacticalAI.cs**: Implements tactical decision-making for AI players, allowing them to make strategic choices based on the game situation.

### 5. Physics Management
- **BallPhysics.cs**: Manages the physics interactions of the football, ensuring realistic movement and collision responses.

### 6. User Interface
- **HUD.cs**: Manages the heads-up display elements, such as score, player stats, and match time.
- **MenuManager.cs**: Handles the main menu and in-game menus, allowing players to navigate through different options.

### 7. Input Management
- **InputManager.cs**: Manages player input for controls, ensuring responsive and intuitive gameplay.

## Asset Management
The project utilizes various asset types to create a rich gaming experience:

- **Prefabs**: Player and ball prefabs allow for easy instantiation and management of game objects.
- **Animations**: Player animations are stored in the Animations directory, providing visual feedback for player actions.
- **Materials and Shaders**: Custom materials and shaders enhance the visual quality of the game.
- **Audio**: Sound effects and background music are organized in dedicated directories for easy access and management.

## Configuration
Game configurations, such as team rosters and attributes, are stored in JSON format within the Resources directory, allowing for easy modifications and updates.

## Conclusion
This technical overview outlines the key components and systems of the football game project. The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, facilitating future enhancements and features.
